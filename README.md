# How to view this project

The main parts of this project are contained in the Jupyter notebooks. Simply click on the .ipynb files,
and GitHub should automatically display the notebooks in your browser. The data (.csv) are stored in a separate 
folder, and the helper functions are stored in the "cleaning.py" file. You can also clone the repo and run 
the notebooks on your computer if you have the Anaconda package installed. 

The NOAA documentation is provided for reference.
